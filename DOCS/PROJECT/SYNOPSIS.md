1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	Background 
Agriculture continues to be a foundational pillar of emerging economies such as India, where a substantial proportion of the population—approximately 58%—depends on farming as its primary source of livelihood. Despite the sector's importance, farmers—especially small and marginal cultivators—face persistent challenges in accessing timely and reliable information related to crop management, weather changes, market prices, and government support services. Traditional information-dissemination channels remain slow, fragmented, and often inaccessible due to language barriers and limited digital exposure. With the rapid expansion of mobile connectivity and digital infrastructure in rural regions, there is a significant opportunity to leverage technology to bridge these longstanding gaps. The Indian government's Digital India initiative and the proliferation of affordable smartphones have created an environment conducive to technology-driven agricultural solutions.
